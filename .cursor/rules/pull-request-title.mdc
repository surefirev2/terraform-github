# Pull Request Title Rule

All pull request titles must follow [semantic commit message](mdc:https:/www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0) rules. This ensures clarity and consistency in the project's history and automation workflows.

## Requirements
- The pull request title should be in the format: `<type>(optional scope): <description>`
- Examples of valid types: `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `style`, `perf`, `ci`, etc.
- The description should be concise and use the imperative mood.

## Example
- `feat: add setup script for environment and hooks`
- `fix(mcp_scripts): correct token replacement logic`

## Additional Notes
- Pull requests that do not follow this rule may be rejected or require renaming before merging.
